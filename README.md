# steveballmer-interview-question-analysis
This Python script simulates the classic Steve Ballmer interview challenge: guess a random number between 1 and 100 using only feedback of "high", "low", or "correct". The code implements an efficient binary search strategy and runs the game 1,000,000 times to analyze the distribution of guesses needed.
