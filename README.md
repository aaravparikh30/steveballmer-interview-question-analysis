# ðŸŽ¯ Steve Ballmer Guessing Game â€” Binary Search Simulation

This project implements and analyzes the famous **Steve Ballmer interview question**, which challenges candidates to guess a number between 1 and 100 with only three types of feedback: `"high"`, `"low"`, or `"correct"`. The goal is to guess the number in as few tries as possible using a logical and efficient strategy.

This repository takes that simple problem and expands it into a **high-scale simulation** â€” running the guessing process **1,000,000 times** and analyzing the distribution of the number of guesses needed using binary search.

## ðŸ§  The Original Question

> "If I pick a number between 1 and 100, and you can only ask whether your guess is high, low, or correct â€” how many tries will it take to guess it?"

This classic interview challenge, attributed to former Microsoft CEO **Steve Ballmer**, tests your ability to think in terms of **algorithmic efficiency**, **logic under constraints**, and **edge-case handling**.

Itâ€™s deceptively simple â€” yet how you approach it says a lot about how you solve problems.

## ðŸš€ What This Project Does

This Python simulation does three main things:

1. **Implements an efficient guessing algorithm** using binary search logic.
2. **Runs the algorithm 1,000,000 times**, each time with a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100.
3. **Visualizes the results** in a histogram showing how many guesses were typically needed.

It also includes:
- A `safety net` to prevent infinite loops or off-by-one errors when the search window collapses.
- Clean plotting with `matplotlib` and performance tracking with `collections.Counter`.

## ðŸ§© How It Works

### Core Algorithm

The strategy used is binary search:
- Start with the full range: `0 to 100`.
- Guess the midpoint.
- Based on feedback (`"high"` or `"low"`), shrink the range.
- Repeat until the guess is `"correct"`.

This method guarantees that the number will be found in **no more than 7 guesses** â€” since `logâ‚‚(100)` is approximately 6.64.

### Safety Net

If the search range collapses (i.e. the high and low bounds are within 1 of each other), the code forces a break by setting the guess to the correct answer directly. This prevents stalling or getting caught in edge cases where integer division prevents further narrowing.

## ðŸ“Š Simulation & Visualization

The script runs the guessing game 1,000,000 times with randomly generated numbers, and for each run:
- Records how many guesses it took
- Aggregates results in a histogram
- Visualizes the distribution

This gives insight into the **frequency of each guess count** and validates the algorithm's consistency.

Example of what you'll see:
```
Most common number of guesses: 7
Rare edge cases needing 8 guesses
No run takes more than 8 guesses (as expected for binary search)
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Why This Matters

This exercise may seem basic, but it touches on several core CS principles:

- **Binary Search** â€“ foundational search algorithm
- **Control flow and branching logic**
- **Error handling and edge-case safety**
- **Statistical thinking through simulation**
- **Visualization to extract insights from raw data**

Itâ€™s a great warm-up project for interview prep, teaching, or exploring algorithmic behavior at scale.
